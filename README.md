# watchiT
Welcome to WatchiT! 
This project came out of all those times you heard, "Hey you should watch this movie I found!"....only to forget an hour later.
So, here's to YOU and all those great film recomendations we don't want you to miss out on. ;)

After logging in, you will be presented with your Dashboard. 
On the Dashboard you may add a film using the form on the right. 
Once added, the most recent addition will always display on your dashboard card to the left.
You may tag moves as "Watch'd!" and a list of these films will populate to your "Watch'd!" list. 
Again, the most recently "Watch'd!" will always show on your Dashboard Card for easy reference.
On the top Navigation bar, click on "WatchiT!" to view a list of movies you have not seen yet. 
Click on the "Watch'd!" navbar link to view a list of already seen films.
Here, you can also "Re-WatchiT!" (move back to your list of wanting to see this again), Delete, or "love" the film by clicking on the heart-eyed emoji.
You always have to option of editing entries, simply use the edit link under your entry. 
Sit back, relax and enjoy your WatchiT!
